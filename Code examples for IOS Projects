Code examples for IOS Projects

NOTE - want to make this a gitHub wiki but project must be public to enable wiki function.  When I have more time I'll just sync this to our group wiki
and use Sublime Merge to manage it?

Commands for committing Xcode projects.

xCode is really-really crappy. Everytime you just look at files, a file called UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate is changed. You don't see it in the overview of xCode itself, through the command line you can.

Quick fix:

Open Terminal
CD to your project directory, and type the following:
git add .
git commit -m "Commit"
git push origin master
